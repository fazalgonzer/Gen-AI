However, it's essential to note that GDP figures can vary depending on the source and methodology used. The World Bank's estimate is based on purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates.\\n\\nIn 2020, Pakistan's nominal GDP was around 276.3 billion USD, which represents a growth rate of 3.1% compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the country's GDP per capita stood at around 1,440 USD.\\n\\nWould you like to know more about Pakistan's economy or is there something else I can help you with?\""
